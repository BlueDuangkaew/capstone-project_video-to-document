# Blue Progress Report — 2025-11-21 to 2025-11-24

**Student Name:** Kadpon Duangkaew  
**Nickname:** Blue

## Date range
2025-11-21 — 2025-11-24 (final stretch, 4 days)

## Activities & accomplishments
- Final polish and documentation updates: consolidated README, `docs/architecture.md` edits, and a demo-ready `output/` example for reviewers.
- Ran a final end-to-end demo locally: upload → transcription → NLP → clip selection → GIF generation → HTML export. Produced polished outputs under `output/` for demo use.
- Completed test coverage improvements and fixed flaky tests; ensured CI is green for fast tests and documented how to run smoke tests with required binaries.
- Prepared final deliverables and a short demo script for presentation day.

## Problems / Issues encountered
- Limited time in final stretch required prioritizing critical fixes over lower-priority UX enhancements.
- Large test artifacts (GIFs) create noise in repository if checked in; decided to keep only small example outputs under `output/` and keep artifacts out of version control where appropriate.

If you'd like, I can now open a single PR that adds all these reports and links them to matching milestone/issue references — shall I do that?
