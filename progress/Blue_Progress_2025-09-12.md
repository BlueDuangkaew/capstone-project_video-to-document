# Blue Progress Report — 2025-09-12 to 2025-09-25

**Student Name:** Kadpon Duangkaew  
**Nickname:** Blue

## Date range
2025-09-12 — 2025-09-25 (bi-weekly)

## Activities & accomplishments
- Onboarded to the codebase: read README, architecture notes, and core modules.
- Ran an initial repository scan of modules related to trimming, transcription, NLP pipeline, frame detection, GIF generation, and web UI.
- Created a detailed milestone plan for the project spanning Sep 12 → Nov 24, documenting weekly goals, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.
- Identified key repo touchpoints to prioritize (trimmer, whisper transcriber, clip detector, gif generation, NLP pipeline, web app) and documented next steps.
- Added a `progress/` directory and this bi-weekly progress file to track updates.

## Problems / Issues encountered
- No explicit timeline or date references found in the repository — milestones had to be constructed from repository state and typical project milestones.
- Heavy dependencies (Whisper, ffmpeg, gifski) can make CI and local testing challenging; recommended mocking for unit tests and smoke tests for heavy steps.
